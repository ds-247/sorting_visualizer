# Sorting Visualizer

Welcome to the **Sorting Visualizer**! This project provides an interactive and modern interface to visualize and analyze the performance of various sorting algorithms. It is designed to help anyone to understand the inner workings of sorting techniques through visualization and time complexity analysis.

## Features

- üé® **Modern UI**: A sleek, and modern user interface for an intuitive experience.
- üîç **Algorithm Visualization**: Visualize five popular sorting algorithms in real-time:
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Bubble Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
- üìä **Performance Analysis**: Includes an analysis section where the time taken by each algorithm to sort a random array of specified size is displayed.
- ‚ö° **Fast Build with Vite**: Built with Vite for faster development and bundling.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Customizable Input**: Set the array size for analysis, and see how different algorithms handle different data sets.
- üîÑ **Interactive Controls**: Control the speed of the visualization, reset arrays, and step through sorting processes.
- üíª **Built with React**: Leverages the power of React to create a dynamic and highly responsive user experience.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: React (with hooks)
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Styling**: Modern CSS/SCSS for a clean UI design
- **Drag and Drop**: DnD Kit for intuitive interaction

## How to Use

1. **Sorting Visualization**: Select one of the five sorting algorithms to watch the algorithm sort a random array of numbers. You can control the speed of the animation and reset the array as needed.
   
2. **Performance Analysis**: Head over to the analysis section to get detailed information about the time taken by each sorting algorithm on a randomly generated array of a specific size. You can adjust the size of the array to see how different algorithms scale with data size.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To get the project up and running locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ds-247/sorting_visualizer.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd sorting-visualizer
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:5173` to view the app.

### Build for Production

To create an optimized production build, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `dist` folder with the optimized static assets.

## Live Demo

## Future Enhancements

- Add more sorting algorithms (e.g., Heap Sort, Radix Sort)
- Add detailed time and space complexity analysis for each algorithm
- Implement a feature to allow custom input arrays
